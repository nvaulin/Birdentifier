This is repository for the  Bioinformatics institute ML course project. We implemented a telegram bot that can recieve a picture of the bird and respond with it's species name. We used pretrained VGG19 model to fine-tune on our data. For now the bot is killed (since it was running on my computer during the presentation). Also we implemented images hashes comparisons to identify photos of our teacher.
